        <p class="title">METAL STRAWS ARE BACK!</p>
        <p class="content">In line with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals and the government’s decision to ban plastic straws in the Federal Territories in Malaysia earlier this year, Sunway Malls introduced metal straws which can be redeemed from participating malls. </p>
        <p class="content">Sunway Malls' decision to ‘break up’ with plastic straws is also in support of Sunway Group’s pledge for a greener future. Several of the malls' tenants are also moving forward with metal straws. Aside from metal, biodegradable paper straws are available at selected outlets. Some tenants have decided to remove plastic straws altogether, while others are rewarding customers who bring their own straws.</p>
        <p class="content">“At Sunway Malls, we take customer experience as one of the main factors to make their experience in the mall a memorable one, and we are pleased to reward our customers in their effort to play a part for our sustainable future,” said Sunway Malls director of marketing Loo Hoey Theen.</p>
        <p class="content">Shoppers simply need to spend RM100 in two receipts to be eligible to redeem their metal straws from the concierge counters of Sunway Pyramid</p>
        <p class="content">Grab your metal straw from 1 April onwards by spending RM100 and above in 2 receipts!</p>
        <p class="content">Redeemable at our concierges on G Floor and LG2.</p>
