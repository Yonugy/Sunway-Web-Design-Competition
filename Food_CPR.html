        <p class="title">FOOD CPR - COMPOST. PLANT. REDUCE</p>
        <p class="content">Did you know? Research shows that Malaysians contribute to more than 16,000 tonnes of food waste daily, enough to feed 12 million hungry mouths three meals a day. The shocking figure continues to worsen during the festive seasons by 15 to 20 percent.</p>
        <p class="content">In an initiative to manage food waste effectively, Sunway Pyramid has invested in a food composting machine to convert food waste from tenants into compost.</p>
        <p class="content">“Sunway Group is committed to advancing the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, one of which is halving Malaysia’s food waste by 2030 – a pledge made by our local government. If we, the nation, continue at our current rate, this pledge would not be met. The ‘COMPOST. PLANT. REDUCE’ campaign is one of our clear commitments to changing food waste habits in Malaysia,” said HC Chan, Chief Executive Officer of Sunway Malls & Theme Parks.</p>
        <p class="content">Together, we can reduce the amount of waste generated to our landfills for a more sustainable environment. Small changes can make a huge difference, and it starts with a few simple steps!</p>
