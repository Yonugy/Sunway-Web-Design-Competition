                    Did you know? Research shows that Malaysians contribute to more than 16,000 tonnes of food waste daily,  
                    enough to feed 12 million hungry mouths three meals a day. The shocking figure continues to worsen during 
                    the festive seasons by 15 to 20 %.<br> <br>
                    In an initiative to manage food waste effectively, 
                    Sunway Pyramid has invested in a food composting machine to convert food waste from tenants into compost.<br>
